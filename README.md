# E-commerce Analytics

# 1: ASK  
The Ask phase aims to determine and define the question that needs to be addressed and to understand stakeholder expectations. This process sets the foundation for the rest of the data analysis.  

## 1.1: Define the Business Objective  
This analysis aims to explore my sales data from eBay, an e-commerce marketplace, to gain insights into increasing sales. A glance at the data reveals a significant drop in sales from Q3 to Q4 over the past four years. Various factors influence buyer decisions in e-commerce, but this analysis will focus on seasonal sales trends to provide actionable insights for boosting Q4 sales and preventing a sharp decline.  

## 1.3: Key Stakeholders  
Since this is my business and data, I am the sole stakeholder in this analysis.  

## 1.4: Guiding Questions   
- **Which categories and products contribute most to revenue, profit, and overall sales performance?**  
- **How do seasonality and specific holidays/events (e.g., Black Friday, Christmas, Back-to-School) impact purchasing behavior?**  
- **Does offering free shipping influence total revenue, profit, or customer purchase decisions?**  
- **What percentage of sales come from repeat customers, and how do they impact profitability?**  
- **Which products and categories have the highest and lowest profit margins?**  
- **What time periods (months, weeks, or days) see the highest and lowest sales, and are there any unexpected seasonal dips? How can they be mitigated?**  

# 2: PREPARE
In the Prepare phase, we examine the data to assess its structure, credibility, and relevance for answering the business questions.

### 2.1: Data Source
